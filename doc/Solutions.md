Multiples of 3 and 5
--------------------

### Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Solution

``` r
# All natural numbers <1000
number_line <- 1:999

# Test if numbers are divisible by 3 or 5
logical_vector <- !(number_line %% 3) | !(number_line %% 5)

# Index number_line using logical_vector and sum the output
sum(number_line[logical_vector])
```

    ## [1] 233168

This solution can be further generalized. Instead of finding the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000, the sum of all multiples of 4, 11, 13, or 25 below 10000 could be found. Or the sum of any arbitrary set of multiples below any arbitrary number.

``` r
library(purrr)

# Generate a logical vector that is TRUE
# for each element in the set, S, that is divisible by m
divis_by <- function(m, S) {
  !(S %% m) # If remainder is zero, returns TRUE
}

sum_multiples_below <- function(multiples, below) {
  # Generate number line
  number_line <- 1:(below-1)
  
  # Map divis_by to each multiple and store each logical vector in a list
  logi_list <- map(multiples, divis_by, S = number_line)
  index <- reduce(logi_list, `|`) # Collapse the list into a single indexing vector,
  sum(number_line[index])         # index the number_line with it, and return the sum
}

sum_multiples_below(multiples = c(3, 5), below = 1000)
```

    ## [1] 233168

``` r
sum_multiples_below(multiples = c(4, 11, 13, 25), below = 10000)
```

Even Fibonacci numbers
----------------------

### Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

``` r
# Generate all fibonacci numbers below 4 Million
fib_under_k <- function(k) {
  fib <- c(1, 2) # First two terms
  while (max(fib) <= k) {
    # Generate Fibonacci numbers until limit is reached
    len <- length(fib)
    fib <- c(fib, fib[len - 1] + fib[len])
  }
  fib
}
fib_seq <- fib_under_k(k = 4000000)

# Subset fib_seq to get only even numbers and then sum them
logi_vec <- !(fib_seq %% 2)
sum(fib_seq[logi_vec])
```

Largest prime factor
--------------------

### Problem 3

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

``` r
# First generate a sequence if prime numbers

# Check primes between the first prime number and half the number in question (inclusive) to see if they will divide the number

# 
```

Largest palindrome product
--------------------------

### Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Smallest multiple
-----------------

### Problem 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Sum square difference
---------------------

### Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
