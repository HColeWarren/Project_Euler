Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... $$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```{r p2}
# Generate all fibonacci numbers below 4 Million
fib_under_k <- function(k) {
  fib <- c(1, 2) # First two terms
  while (max(fib) <= k) {
    # Generate Fibonacci numbers until limit is reached
    len <- length(fib)
    fib <- c(fib, fib[len - 1] + fib[len])
  }
  fib
}
fib_seq <- fib_under_k(k = 4000000)

# Subset fib_seq to get only even numbers and then sum them
logi_vec <- !(fib_seq %% 2)
sum(fib_seq[logi_vec])
```
